# Laravel with php7-apache 

This is a reference sample for Laravel application running with php7-apache and evencually deploy to AWS Fargate

# Pre-requisities

Prepare your docker environment in your laptop or just open an [AWS Cloud9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/tw/cloud9/). 


# download the repository

```
$ curl -L https://github.com/pahud/fargate-samples/archive/master.zip -o fargate-samples.zip
$ unzip fargate-samples.zip
$ cd fargate-samples-master/laravel-workshop
```


# Build

build the base image and the laravel image on top of it

```
$ make build
```

this will build `udn/laravel:latest` from local docker environment.

# Run

local run this image 

```
$ make run
#http://localhost:8080/laravel/public/
docker inspect laravel-php7-apache > /dev/null && docker rm -f laravel-php7-apache
laravel-php7-apache
docker run -d --name laravel-php7-apache -p 8080:80 udn/laravel
98e1df69d5b110a9dc8596797080b82c77c283f94ee2ce07430bddb4cde90f9e
```
The application will start and listen on localhost:8080

# Validate

open **http://localhost:8080/laravel/public/** from your laptop to view the Laravel application

Alternatively, if you run it on AWS Cloud9, you can configure the preview URL as `https://$C9_HOSTNAME/laravel/public/`

And click `open https://....` to preview the Laravel in the built-in browser in Cloud9

# Deploy to AWS Fargate

Now, let's deploy our Laravel application to **AWS Fargate** as a service behind **Application Load Balancer(ALB)**.



## Create ECR repository and push image to it

Let's create a repo named `larval-php7-apache` in Tokyo region(ap-northeast-1)

```
$ aws --region ap-northeast-1 ecr create-repository --repository-name laravel-php7-apache                                                                                                       
{
    "repository": {
        "registryId": "903779448426", 
        "repositoryName": "laravel-php7-apache", 
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:ap-northeast-1:903779448426:repository/laravel-php7-apache", 
        "createdAt": 1541336935.0, 
        "repositoryUri": "903779448426.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/laravel-php7-apache"
    }
}
```

Please copy the `repositoryUri`.



tag the local image to the repositoryUri



```
$ docker tag udn/laravel 903779448426.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/laravel-php7-apache
```

(please note your `repositorUri` will be diffierent with the one provided above)

Before pushing the image to ECR, we need to get the ECR authentication and `docker login` with it.

```
$ eval $(aws --region ap-northeast-1 ecr get-login --no-include-email)
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/ec2-user/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

 

OK. Let's push to ECR.

```
$ docker push 903779448426.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/laravel-php7-apache
The push refers to repository [903779448426.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/laravel-php7-apache]

```



Now the Docker image is in ECR(Tokyo region). We'll process to the next step to use `fargate-cli` to launch the service.



## Prepare Fargate-CLI

Please follow the [instruction](https://github.com/pahud/fargate-samples/issues/1) to install the `fargate-cli`



### Create an ALB in Tokyo Region with Fargate-CLI

```
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 lb create laravel-lb --port 80
[i] Created load balancer laravel-lb
```



### Create the service behind the ALB

```
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service create laravel-app --lb laravel-lb --image 903779448426.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/laravel-php7-apache --port 80 --num 1
[i] Created service laravel-app

```

### 

### Service list, ps and info

```
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service list

```



### Update the Health Check on Target Group

ALB Target Group by default will health check `HTTP` on `/`, however, as we run laravel app at `/laravel/public/` we need to modify the health check point from `/` to `/laravel/public/`

![](./images/04.png)



And make sure the target is `healthy`

![](./images/05.png)



### Validate

Get the Load Balancer `DNS Name` from the `fargate service info` above and visit the DNS Name directly

```
http://$YOUR_ELB_DNS_NAME/laravel/public/
```

![](./images/03.png)



## Service scale out or scale in



```
// add 2
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service scale laravel-app +2
[i] Scaled service laravel-app to 3
// set to 5
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service scale laravel-app 5
[i] Scaled service laravel-app to 5
// set to 1
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service scale laravel-app 1
[i] Scaled service laravel-app to 1
// set to 0
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service scale laravel-app 0
[i] Scaled service laravel-app to 0
```



## Clean up and destroy the service



```
// always set to 0 before destroying the service
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service scale laravel-app 0
[i] Scaled service laravel-app to 0
// destroy the service
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 service destroy laravel-app 
[i] Destroyed service laravel-app
// destroy the ALB
$ fargate --region ap-northeast-1 lb destroy laravel-lb
[i] Destroyed load balancer laravel-lb
```



## Replace Apache with Caddy

For performance and simplicity concern, you may replace apache with [Caddy Server](https://caddyserver.com/) with php7 as the web engine of your base image . In `laravel/Dockerfile` simply comment `FROM udn/php` and uncomment `FROM caddy-php` and `make build` again to re-build the image.

```
#FROM udn/php
# umcomment to build with caddy-php
FROM caddy-php
```
